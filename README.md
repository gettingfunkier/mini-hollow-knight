# Mini Hollow Knight!
A terminal-based, Hollow Knight inspired boss rush minigame!
### - Nail attack
Gain a soul for every attack. For every 3 hits in a row, do a Great Slash to destroy your foes! Both the player and the enemy have a chance to dodge and avoid damage
### - Heal yourself
Use one soul to get back lost HP! You can't heal past your max, and you're still vulnerable to attacks while you heal.
### - Cast a spell
Pay some soul to cast either Vengeful Spirit or Howling Wraiths, and do immense damage! You'll be punished if you try to cast a spell without the proper soul, and all spells can still be dodged.

----
### - Pick a charm
Unbreakable Strength for + nail damage, Shaman Stone for + spell damage, Lifeblood Heart for higher max HP.
### - Tune the difficulty
Available in both normal and hard modes, with different boss rosters.
